### OVERVIWE
Conventional pharmaceutical warehouses mostly use man power to manage and handle goods inside their warehouse complexes. But this manual method has some inevitable downsides which cause losses in both time and profitability. In this project, we are trying to address this issue by developing a fully automated warehouse management which will minimize the drawbacks while improving efficiency and profitability.


### Our Solution
   ![alt text](https://github.com/cepdnaclk/e16-3yp-smart-pharmaceutical-warehousing/blob/main/website/Overall.png?raw=true)

    Our solution consists three components :-
        1. Fully automated robot operated warehouse
        2. Control interface to control and override (if necessary) the operations of robots
        3. Warehouse database with a website and a mobile applications, as an interface to retailers to make their purchases


### How It Work 

    Once a client places an order, the database is updated and the computer fetches the relevant information about the goods and triggers up the local warehouse controller. The warehouse controller then generates instructions and are passed to the robot arm and the delivery robot to perform the task. Here, the local controller sends status messages like Insert, Takeout, Store etc... while they are processing the goods. Once the fetching of goods is done, they are delivered to the client.
