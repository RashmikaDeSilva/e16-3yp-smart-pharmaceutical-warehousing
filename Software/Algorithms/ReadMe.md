This folder contains the algorithms designed for Scheduling orders/AGVs, Routing and Collision avoidance. 

* Scheduling Algorithm :-

Aim of scheduling orders/AGVs is to dispatch a set of AGVs to complete a batch of pickup/drop-off jobs to achieve certain goals under given constraints.
Minimize total travel time and AGV idle time while maximizing the system throughput were the main concern.
Completion of all pickup/drop-off jobs under given priority or deadline was also taken into consideration.

Every order is breakdown into set of pickup/drop-off jobs. Processing time of a pickup/drop-off job is given by;
                
Tp = Tld + Ttr + Tc    ; where      Tld  - loading/unloading time
                                    Ttr   - travel time, 
                                    Tc -  path conflict resolution time    
                
Total processing time of the order is the summation of  Tp over the number of pickup/drop-off jobs.

Every order is assigned with a waiting time (Tw) which counts the time a particular order has been waiting once it‚Äôs been placed.

For each and every order, the  value Tw/ùö∫Tp is calculated and the tuple ((Tw/ùö∫Tp), i) is put into an array sorted with the first element of the tuple.

Order corresponding to the ArgMax of the array is then popped out from the array and sent to be processed.

Taking ArgMax of the array (order corresponding to the max(Tw/ùö∫Tp) ensures that orders with short processing time or orders that has been waiting longer period gets priority.

* Routing of AGVs

Aim of routing is to find a shortest possible time path with minimum number of turnings.
Topological map of the warehouse floor plan was modeled with points and line segments connecting points. 
Graph theoretic approach was used with a distant function to find the optimum path.
